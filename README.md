## Usage

When you go to the Weather Dashboard for the first time, it will ask you for your location. If you press "Allow", it will automatically display the weather data for your area.

Alternatively, you can just type in the City name and press Search.

Every time a city name is entered, the weather data is automatically displayed and a link appears on the left so you can revisit the weather data for these cities later on. You can look at the updated weather data for this city simply by clicking on one of the links to the left of the site as shown below.
